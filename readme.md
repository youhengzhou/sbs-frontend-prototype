## Setup

### 1. Installation

This website is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

To setup Hugo, follow the Hugo authored [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your operating system of choice.

For Windows users, I recommend following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7umPCU-8xc) if you are unfamilliar with choco.

### 2. Start Hugo

To start Hugo, navigate to the directory where you cloned this project and run the following command:

```
hugo server
